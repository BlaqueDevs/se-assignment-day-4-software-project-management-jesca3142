## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall Methodology is a project management method  where each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase  while agile methodologies is a project management method where the project is divided in small units or sprints.

Advantages of waterfall methodologies are;
it is easy to manage and track progress of the project
focuses majorly on documentation which is important for future use
it is easy to allocate resources that are needed for the project
it is structred in a way that is well understood

Disdvantages of waterfall methodologies are;
there is risk of miscommunication since what is required for the project is gathered upfront.
it may take longer to complete a project since one phase should be completed before going on with the next one
it is late adabtable for change if need be .

Advantages of agile methodologies are;
flexible for change if needed through the project
it makes it easier for customers to see the results of the projects since the project is done in sprints.
testing is done in each sprints making it easier to identify issues and solve them

Disdvantages of agile  methodologies are;
it needs involment of the customer and if they are not easy accesible it may cause the project to delay 
since it is not easy to track changes then the cost and resources needed may exceed the required set budget
with no clear management the project can be chaotic and difficult to manage 


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall is better suited for projects where the requirements are well-defined from the start and unlikely to change, such as construction or some hardware development projects.

Agile is ideal for projects where flexibility is crucial, such as software development, where requirements may evolve based on feedback and market changes.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

1.Monitor test results
2.bug reports
3.test coverage to assess the effectiveness of testing efforts.
4.Conduct reviews and retrospectives to identify areas for improvement in QA processes and methodologies

Why is it important to maintain high standards in Quality Assurance.
high-quality standards results in a better user experience
Maintaining high-quality standards during development makes future updates and maintenance easier
Software that meets high-quality standards reflects well on the company, building trust with customers
Market Competitiveness; Delivering high-quality software that performs well and meets user expectations is a competitive advantage in the marketplace.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Clarifies Project Objectives:having a well define scope helps the team set goals and the outcomes they want to archieve
Helps with Resource and Budget Planning:it is clear to identify what is needed for the project
Improves Time Management:it is easier to make a schedule and meet deadlines
risk management;it helps in identifing potential risks and challanges that may be faced 
A well-defined project scope aligns all stakeholders (clients, team members, and sponsors) with the project’s objectives, deliverables, and timelines.
 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is the breaking down of project tasks into sub projects making it easier to plan and allocate resources.
 Why is work Breakdown Structure useful;
  It indicates on what needs to be done, ensuring that no part of the project is forgotten.
 This helps  each team member knows their specific responsibilities, ensuaring accountability and improving collaboration.
  leads to  accurate scheduling and resource allocation, helping to avoid overestimations or underestimations that could impact the project’s timeline or budget.
 Early identification of risks allows the project team to address issues on time.
By sharing the WBS with all stakeholders, it helps keep everyone to be  informed, and engaged throughout the project.
Ensures that the project is complete and nothing has been overlooked in the planning process.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
helps team members understand the project’s timeline and the  deadlines they need to meet.
helps identify when specific resources (e.g., personnel, equipment, budget) will be needed for each task. 
helps in  planning,  thus reducing the impact of risks on the project timeline.
Monitoring progress against the schedule allows for early identification of delays or issues, giving the project manager the chance to make adjustments and maintain control over the timeline.
Transparent communication improves stakeholder alignment, increases confidence, and helps manage expectations throughout the project.
With accurate and up-to-date scheduling data, project managers can make timely, data-driven decisions that keep the project on track.

how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
makes it easy to see the overall project timeline, understand when each task will occur, and identify any potential overlaps or gaps in the schedule also helping project managers stay on top of deadlines and make adjustments as needed.
